                <div class="item-title">Chip8</div>
                <div class="item-text">A Chip8 emulator written entirely in Rust. The "hello world" project of emulator development, I learned not only specifics of how a chip-8 computer worked but also computers in general, covering cpu registers, the stack, binary operators, and cpu opcodes.</div>

                <div class="item-title">AsyncChat</div>
                <div class="item-text">An asynchronous, Anonymous, and End to End Encrypted chat app focused on security and privacy. This application used the Tornado Framework, Python, and WebSockets to power the backend and ReactJS for the frontend. I wrote this during my senior year in high school and ended up winning the congressional app challenge for my district.</div>

                <div class="item-title">Tetris</div>
                <div class="item-text">A Tetris clone written entirely in Rust. At one point I had cross compilation setup so that it could also run on windows (see the releases section of Github), but soon after adding more sdl dependencies that broke :(. Overall a great project that helped cement my skills in Rust and give me a glimpse into the world of game development.</div>

                <div class="item-text">Written as a Proof of Concept for an Economics project, branded is an online store written in Python. I used Flask for the web framework and, for the first time ever, tried out an ORM, SQLAlchemy. Due to the time constraint it was hastily written, but still was a very valuable learning experience.</div>

                <div class="item-text">Technically not a programming project, but somewhat technical. As an avid Linux user, I am in a constant state of tweaking and changing my Linux desktop. This repository has seen it all, at least every time I decided to completely start over. Included are config files for everything from chromium to the linux kernel. Also included are custom scripts that I used over the years for various tasks such as autodocking or custom volume widgets.</div>

                <div class="item-text">Okay, I get it. It's not an operating system. It doesn't even remotely try to be an operating system. But the name sticks. This is a web app written with ReactJS that tries to simulate a computer desktop with different windows and applications. It features a windowing system, a persistent filesystem, an application launcher, and a fake terminal with limited functionality</div>

                <div class="item-title">Basketball Stats</div>
                <div class="item-text">An analysis of my high school basketball team's statistics. During my senior year I took a deep dive into the world of data analysis, and as a project I asked my school's basketball coach for last season's data. Using a Jupyter notebook I explored the data through various techniques and visualisations and constructed a metric for player effectiveness.</div>
